        "BlogDescription": "Starting in December 2020, we will be delivering .NET Core updates on Windows via Microsoft Update. We have received many requests for this, particularly from organizations that acquire and manage all of their Microsoft-related updates via Microsoft (or Windows) Update. This change will enable organizations to manage .NET Framework and .NET Core updates in the same way. If you don’t want to use Microsoft Update to update .NET on your machines, you don’t have to, and can continue using one of the existing options",
        "BackGround": "When updates for the product are available on Windows Update, the job of an enterprise IT administrator tasked with ensuring security patches are installed in a timely manner is mostly fully automated.Until now, we did not deliver .NET Core updates automatically via Microsoft Update. This was because of earlier customer feedback around potentially breaking apps. This feedback was centered around .NET Framework major/minor feature updates (for example going from 4.5 to 4.8) which installed in-place rather than side-by-side with earlier versions In the .NET Core case, major/minor (feature) updates always install side-by-side. Only monthly servicing updates install in-place and replace previous servicing updates. We are delivering .NET Core servicing updates monthly without issues. .NET Core servicing updates have evolved from fully side-by-side installs to patches that replace earlier versions with “runtime roll-forward”, so once an update is deployed apps can use the latest (serviced) runtime version automatically."

        "BlogTitle": "The history of C#",
        "BlogDescription": "The C# language relies on types and methods in what the C# specification defines as a standard library for some of the features. The .NET platform delivers those types and methods in a number of packages. One example is exception processing. Every throw statement or expression is checked to ensure the object being thrown is derived from Exception. Similarly, every catch is checked to ensure that the type being caught is derived from Exception. Each version may add new requirements. To use the latest language features in older environments, you may need to install specific libraries. These dependencies are documented in the page for each specific version. You can learn more about the relationships between language and library for background on this dependency.",
